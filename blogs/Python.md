1. **What are Python’s key features?**
    - Easy-to-learn syntax.
    - Dynamically typed.
    - Interpreted.
    - Extensive standard library.
    - Supports multiple programming paradigms.
2. **What is the difference between Python 2 and Python 3?**
    
    Python 3 is the modern version with Unicode by default, improved syntax (e.g., `print()` function), and better libraries. Python 2 is outdated.
    
3. **How is Python interpreted?**
    
    Python code is converted into bytecode and executed by the Python virtual machine (PVM).
    
4. **What are Python’s built-in data types?**
    - Numeric: `int`, `float`, `complex`
    - Sequence: `str`, `list`, `tuple`
    - Set: `set`, `frozenset`
    - Mapping: `dict`
    - Boolean: `bool`
5. **What are mutable and immutable data types in Python?**
    - Mutable: Can be modified (e.g., `list`, `dict`, `set`).
    - Immutable: Cannot be modified (e.g., `str`, `tuple`, `int`).
6. **What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy?**
    - Shallow copy: Copies only the top-level structure.
    - Deep copy: Copies all levels of an object.
7. **What are Python’s namespaces?**
    
    A namespace is a container that maps names to objects, like variables and functions.
    
8. **How are arguments passed in Python: by reference or by value?**
    
    Python uses **pass-by-object-reference**. Mutable objects can be modified, but reassignment creates a new object.
    
9. **What is the purpose of the `self` keyword?**
    
    Refers to the current instance of a class, used to access instance variables and methods.
    
10. **Explain the difference between `is` and `==` operators.**
    - `is`: Checks object identity (same memory address).
    - `==`: Checks value equality.

### **Advanced Python**

1. **What are Python decorators, and how are they used?**
    
    Functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods:
    
    ```python
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper():
            print("Before function")
            func()
            print("After function")
        return wrapper
    ```
    
2. **What are generators in Python?**
    
    Functions that yield values one at a time, used for memory efficiency:
    
    ```python
    def generator():
        yield 1    yield 2
    ```
    
3. **Explain the difference between `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and instance methods.**
    - `@staticmethod`: Does not access class or instance.
    - `@classmethod`: Accesses the class via `cls`.
    - Instance methods: Access instance via `self`.
4. **What is a Python context manager? How is it implemented using `with`?**
    
    Manages resources, ensuring proper cleanup (e.g., closing files):
    
    ```python
    with open('file.txt') as f:
        data = f.read()
    ```
    
5. **What are metaclasses in Python?**
    
    Classes that define behavior of other classes. Used for class customization.
    
6. **Explain the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.**
    
    GIL ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time.
    
7. **What is the difference between `deepcopy()` and `copy()` in the `copy` module?**
    - `copy()`: Shallow copy.
    - `deepcopy()`: Recursively copies all objects.
8. **How can you manage memory in Python?**
    
    Python uses automatic garbage collection, but you can manually use `del` or manage references.
    
9. **Explain Python’s `args` and `*kwargs`.**
    - `args`: Accepts variable positional arguments.
    - `*kwargs`: Accepts variable keyword arguments.
10. **What is the purpose of the `__init__` method in Python?**
    
    Initializes a class instance, setting initial values.

    Redefining a parent class method in a child class.
    
7. **Explain the concept of polymorphism with examples.**
    
    Same method names behaving differently based on context (e.g., method overriding).
    
8. **How is multiple inheritance handled in Python?**
    
    Python resolves conflicts using the Method Resolution Order (MRO).
    
9. **What is the purpose of the `super()` function?**

    ```python
    def coin_change(coins, amount):
        coins.sort(reverse=True)
        count = 0    for coin in coins:
            if amount == 0:
                break        count += amount // coin
            amount %= coin
        return count
    ```

### **Dynamic Programming**

1. **What is dynamic programming?**
    - A method for solving problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and solving each only once.
    - Examples: Fibonacci, Knapsack problem.
2. **How would you solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming?**
    - Use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value for the first `i` items and weight `w`.
3. **Explain the Fibonacci sequence problem and its dynamic programming solution.**
    - Use a bottom-up approach to store Fibonacci numbers:
    
    ```python
    def fibonacci(n):
        dp = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dp.append(dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])
        return dp[n]
    ```

        'A': ['B', 'C'],
        'B': ['A', 'D'],
        'C': ['A', 'D'],
        'D': ['B', 'C']
    }
    ```
    
2. **What is Dijkstra’s algorithm, and how is it implemented in Python?**
    - Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes.
    - Implementation uses a priority queue:
    
    ```python
    import heapq
    def dijkstra(graph, start):
        pq, distances = [(0, start)], {start: 0}
        while pq:
            current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)
            for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:
                distance = current_distance + weight
                if neighbor not in distances or distance < distances[neighbor]:
                    distances[neighbor] = distance
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))
        return distances
    ```
    
3. **Explain the difference between Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms for MST.**
    - **Prim’s**: Builds the MST starting from a node, adding the smallest edge connected to the tree.
    - **Kruskal’s**: Sorts edges by weight and adds them to the MST if they don’t form a cycle.
4. **How does the Bellman-Ford algorithm differ from Dijkstra’s?**
    - Bellman-Ford works with negative weights and relaxes edges repeatedly.
    - Dijkstra is faster but requires non-negative weights.
5. **How can you detect a cycle in a directed graph?**
    - Use depth-first search (DFS) and maintain a recursion stack.

    ```python
    def max_sum_subarray(arr, k):
        max_sum, window_sum = 0, sum(arr[:k])
        for i in range(len(arr) - k):
            window_sum += arr[i + k] - arr[i]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
        return max_sum
    ```
    
2. **How does the two-pointer technique work?**
    - Uses two pointers to traverse the array in different directions, solving problems like pair sums or palindromes efficiently.
3. **Explain the concept of backtracking with an example.**
    - Backtracking explores all possibilities but abandons paths that fail to satisfy constraints.
    - Example: Solving N-Queens problem.
4. **What are divide-and-conquer algorithms?**

2. **What is the difference between `O(n)` and `O(log n)`?**
    - O(n): Linear growth; processes each element (e.g., linear search).
    - O(log n): Logarithmic growth; halves the problem size at each step (e.g., binary search).
3. **What are some ways to optimize Python code?**
    - Use built-in functions and libraries (e.g., `sum`, `sorted`).
    - Use list comprehensions instead of loops.
    - Avoid redundant calculations; use memoization.
    - Leverage generators for large data.
    - Use NumPy for numerical computations.
